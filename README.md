# GeometryInterpolate

I'm messing around with newtype and typeclasses.

There must be a way to easily add Foldable to Polyline.  
I have tried using *GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving* but still not working.  
[source file](https://github.com/BebeSparkelSparkel/GeometryInterpolate/blob/master/src/Circle.hs)  

Do you know of any resources that demonstrate how to do this?
